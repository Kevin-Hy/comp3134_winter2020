FOR getusers_1.php

1) Nothing shows up, that is because Ben is in the database, but active = 0 so it would not satisfy the condition

2) Ben shows up as a query result, as the '-- ignores the rest of the result, so active will be ignored.

3) No result shows up because there is an opening and closing quote, the ben' or 1=1 will essentially look like this in sql
select * from users where firstname='ben' or 1=1' and active=1; which would not work because of the quote.


FOR getusers_2.php

1)As the same, Ben is db, but active = 0. Will not show

2)Does not show up, as the prepared statement disallows these sort of injections/vunerability
to modify the SQL statement.

3)Nothing shows up, as said above the prepared statement will project from sql injection.
